        <div class="info">I am a high school student pursuing my associates degree with an expected graduation date of 2020. I am proficient in Python and Java. Python is my first programing language, and I first learned it in the fall of 2017 through a highschool computer science course I took. Java is the second language I took on, and I was introduced to it in a collage level computer science course durring the fall of 2018. Since then, I have self taught myself beyond what either class covered in both languages. As demonstrated by this website, I also have experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Overtime, I have picked up other skills such as acting, costuming, audio-visual editing, writing, digital art, cinematography, costuming, and prop building. I've dabbled in robotics, engineering, chemistry, and 3D modeling as well. I plan to, in the future, take the skills I have learned and grow my own business.
